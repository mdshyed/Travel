          question: "How do I create my first trip in Kerala Travel Tracker?",
          answer: "To create your first trip, tap the '+' button on the home screen or navigate to the 'Add Trip' tab. Fill in your origin, destination, travel date, and mode of transport. The app will automatically calculate your carbon footprint and save the trip to your profile."
        },

          question: "What transport modes are supported in Kerala?",
          answer: "We support all major Kerala transport modes including buses (KSRTC, private), trains, boats/ferries, auto-rickshaws, taxis, private cars, bicycles, and walking. Each mode has specific carbon footprint calculations based on Kerala's transport data."
        },
        {
          question: "How accurate is the carbon footprint calculation?",
          answer: "Our calculations are based on official emission factors from the Ministry of Environment, Government of India, combined with Kerala-specific transport data. The accuracy is within 5-10% for most transport modes."

        },
        {
          question: "What are Popular Routes and how do they work?",
          answer: "Popular Routes show frequently traveled paths in Kerala, based on aggregated user data. You can browse routes by category (backwaters, hill stations, beaches, cultural sites) and get detailed information about transport options, typical costs, and travel times."
        },
        {

        },
        {
          question: "How does the app handle Kerala's monsoon season?",
          answer: "During monsoon (June-September), the app provides weather alerts, suggests alternate routes when roads are flooded, and includes monsoon-specific travel tips. Transport schedules are updated in real-time during this period."
        },
        {
          question: "Are local Kerala transport schedules integrated?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I use the app without sharing my data?",
          answer: "Yes! You can disable data sharing in Settings while still using all core features. Some community features like Popular Routes may have limited functionality without data sharing."

        },
        {
          question: "My carbon footprint calculations seem incorrect",

          question: "I'm not receiving notifications",
